# ESP32-chip

to connect the reception robot to internet we need to add ESP32 to the microcontroller circuit so we can save and load some data. this task manily about networking. We start to connect the robots with cloud service, so we could save data and control the Robot online. The ESP32 chip was responsible to connect the microcontroller with internet through router. The ESP32 chip create an access point with a SSID name and a password when then itâ€™s connected to internet using Wi-Fi STA. Wi-Fi STA is a way to be connected to internet using the 802.11 protocol to a nearby router.ESP32 chip is a programable chip by burning the code from Arduino program. We mange to transform the data that enter through data pin to https web page. After we finish programming the circuits. We can save data like the number of visitors to the place and are they happy or unhappy to visit the place and other feedbacks.
